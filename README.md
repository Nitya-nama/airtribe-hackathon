# Merchant Payment Insights Dashboard

This project provides a web-based dashboard for merchants to gain quick, conversational insights into their payment data using a natural language interface. Leveraging a Flask backend for data processing and integration with the OpenAI API for intelligent responses, it allows users to ask questions about transactions, refunds, and performance, receiving data-backed answers and visualizations.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Conversational AI:** Ask questions about your payment data in plain English.
* **Transaction Analysis:** Get insights into successful payments, total revenue, and transaction volumes for specific dates or periods.
* **Refund Management:** Analyze refund trends, identify spikes, and understand root causes.
* **Payment Method Performance:** Evaluate which payment methods are performing best and track their trends over time.
* **Customer Behavior Insights:** Understand repeat rates and average order values for customers using different payment methods.
* **Proactive Alerts & Recommendations:** Receive automated alerts on unusual activity (e.g., high refunds, significant sales dips/surges) and recommendations (e.g., EMI options, weekend sales forecasts).
* **Dynamic Charting:** Visualize key metrics with interactive line, bar, and pie charts generated directly from your data.
* **Light/Dark Mode:** A customizable theme for better user experience.
* **PDF Export:** Download a summary of your insights and alerts.
* **Secure Login:** Basic authentication to access the dashboard.

## üöÄ Technologies Used

**Backend:**
* **Python 3:** The core language for the backend logic.
* **Flask:** A lightweight web framework for building the API.
* **Pandas:** For efficient data loading, manipulation, and analysis of CSV files.
* **OpenAI Python Client:** To interact with the OpenAI GPT model for natural language processing and generating insightful responses.

**Frontend:**
* **HTML5:** Structure of the web application.
* **CSS3:** Custom styling for a modern and responsive user interface.
* **JavaScript:** For dynamic content, user interaction, and fetching data from the Flask backend.
* **Chart.js:** A powerful JavaScript library for rendering various types of charts and graphs.
* **jsPDF:** For generating PDF reports of the insights.
* **Google Fonts (Poppins):** For enhanced typography.

## üì¶ Data Files

This application relies on the following CSV files, which should be placed in the root directory alongside `app.py`:

* `settlement_data.csv`: Contains primary transaction and settlement records.
* `txn_refunds.csv`: Contains details about transaction refunds.
* `Support Data(Sheet1).csv`: Contains customer support ticket data.

_Note: If CSVs are missing or problematic, the backend generates mock data to ensure basic functionality._

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get your Merchant Payment Insights Dashboard up and running:

### 1. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/prnvshlk7777/pl_online_hackathon_2025
cd airtribe-hackathon


### 2. Set up Python Backend

It's recommended to use a Python virtual environment.



# Create a virtual environment

python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment

# On Windows:

.\\venv\\Scripts\\activate

# On macOS/Linux:

source venv/bin/activate

# Install backend dependencies

pip install Flask pandas openai requests

3. Place Your Data Files
Ensure the settlement_data.csv, txn_refunds.csv, and Support Data(Sheet1).csv files are in the airtribe-hackathon directory (the same directory as app.py).

4. OpenAI API Key Configuration
The application is configured to retrieve the OpenAI API key from the environment. Ensure you have an active OpenAI API Key.

In the Canvas environment where this application is designed to run, the API key is automatically injected when api_key="" is used in the OpenAI client initialization. You should generally leave api_key="" as is within the app.py file.

If you are running this project purely locally outside of a Canvas-like environment and encounter "Authentication Error" or "Missing API Key" errors, you would typically set it as an environment variable before running app.py:


# On Windows (in Command Prompt):

set OPENAI\_API\_KEY=YOUR\_OPENAI\_API\_KEY\_HERE

# On macOS/Linux:

export OPENAI\_API\_KEY="YOUR\_OPENAI\_API\_KEY\_HERE"

# IMPORTANT: Replace YOUR\_OPENAI\_API\_KEY\_HERE with your actual key.

# This is usually not necessary in the Canvas environment.

5. Run the Flask Backend
With your virtual environment activated, run the Flask application:


python app.py

The backend server will start, typically running on http://127.0.0.1:5000 (or http://localhost:5000). You should see output similar to * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000 in your terminal.

6. Access the Frontend
Open your web browser and navigate to:


[http://127.0.0.1:5000/index.html](https://www.google.com/search?q=http://127.0.0.1:5000/index.html)

(Or simply http://localhost:5000/index.html if it redirects)

You will be presented with a login screen.

Username: admin
Password: admin
After successful login, the dashboard will become visible.

##üí° Usage Examples
Once logged in, type your questions into the input field and click "Ask." Here are some example prompts:

General Sales:

"How much did I receive in successful payments today?"
"What was my total revenue yesterday?"
"How much did I receive on 2025-01-20?" (Adjust date to match your data)
"What were the total sales for February 2025?" (Adjust month/year to match your data)
Refund Analysis:

"Why did my refunds spike yesterday?"
"Analyze the root cause of refunds on 2025-01-18." (Adjust date to match your data)
Payment Method Performance:

"Which payment method is performing best this week?"
"Show me the trend for UPI payments this month."
"Give me the transaction count for each payment method."
Customer Behavior:

"Analyze customer behavior for Credit Card payments."
"Tell me about repeat rates for mobile customers."
Recommendations & Forecasts:

"Should I enable EMI options?"
"What are the expected transactions for the upcoming weekend?"
System Alerts:

"Are there any alerts?"
"Check for any unusual transaction volume today."
‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting
"Connection error" with AI / "Missing bearer authentication":

This indicates the Flask backend cannot reach api.openai.com.
Verify Internet Connectivity: Ensure the machine running Flask has internet access (e.g., by visiting https://www.google.com or https://api.openai.com/v1/models in a browser on that machine; if https://api.openai.com/v1/models gives a JSON error, connection is fine, issue is API key).
Firewall: Temporarily disable local firewalls (Windows Defender, macOS Firewall, ufw on Linux) for testing. If on a corporate network, contact IT to allow outbound HTTPS (port 443) traffic to api.openai.com.
Proxy: If you're behind a corporate proxy, you might need to set HTTP_PROXY and HTTPS_PROXY environment variables before running python app.py (e.g., export HTTPS_PROXY="http://your.proxy.server:port").
API Key: In the Canvas environment, the API key is injected. Ensure api_key="" in client = OpenAI(api_key="") and that the environment provides a valid key.
"I currently only have transaction data from YYYY-MM-DD. I cannot provide insights for..."

This is not an error, but an informational message. Your loaded data (from CSVs or mock data) has a specific date range. Query only for dates that fall within or after 2025-01-15 for transaction data, and 2025-01-03 for refund data.
Charts not appearing:

Ensure the Flask backend is returning chartData in the correct JSON format (with labels, data, and type).
Check your browser's developer console for JavaScript errors.


##üîÆ Future Enhancements

User Management: Implement a more robust user authentication system.

Custom Date Range Selection: Allow users to specify start and end dates directly in the UI.

More Data Sources: Integrate with live payment gateways or other financial APIs.

Advanced Analytics: Implement more sophisticated predictive models (e.g., churn prediction, lifetime value).

Dashboard Customization: Allow users to drag-and-drop widgets or customize their view.

Sentiment Analysis: Integrate support ticket data with sentiment analysis to identify urgent customer issues.
